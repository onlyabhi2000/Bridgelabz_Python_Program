Tree traversal : 
Inorder traversal ---->
First, visit all the nodes in the left subtree
Then the root node
Visit all the nodes in the right subtree


Preorder traversal ---->
Visit root node
Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
Visit all the nodes in the right subtree


Postorder traversal ---->
Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
Visit the root node
