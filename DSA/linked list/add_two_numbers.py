"""
Problem Statement: Given the heads of two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

Examples:

Input Format: 
(Pointer/Access to the head of the two linked lists)

num1  = 243, num2 = 564

l1 = [2,4,3]
l2 = [5,6,4]

Result: sum = 807; L = [7,0,8]
