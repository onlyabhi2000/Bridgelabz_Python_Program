What is exceptions : Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to manage runtime errors, preventing abrupt program termination. 

we have 4 blocks to handles the exceptions : 

1. try block   #code containing exceptions(suspicious code)
2. except block  #[exception name] code to handle exceptions(if occurs)
3. else block  #code to execute if no exceptions occured
4. finally bloack    #Always executed
